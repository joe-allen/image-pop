# Image Pop:

A web component that can be use on any html page by including the script and element

script: `./img-pop.min.js`
element: `<img-pop src='img.jpg' title='' text=''></img-pop>`

## To Use:

## Compatiblity:
Edge 15 and above.

Edge 15 and IE 11 and below do not have image animation, but will still display image (keep in mind, if you're targeting these browsers what you add to the `title` and `text` attributes should be considered since they will not be shown).
